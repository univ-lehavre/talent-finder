/**
 * Application-specific components module.
 *
 * This module contains components that are specific to the talent-finder application.
 * They wrap generic UI components from $lib/ui and inject i18n content from $lib/content.
 *
 * Components are organized by route:
 * - common/    : Shared across multiple routes (Navbar, Footer, Modal, etc.)
 * - home/      : Components for / route
 * - login/     : Components for /login route
 * - dashboard/ : Components for /dashboard route
 * - theme/     : Components for /theme route
 * - repository/: Components for /repository route
 * - api-docs/  : Components for /api/docs route
 *
 * Use these components in pages/routes for convenience - they come pre-configured
 * with localized content.
 *
 * Generic UI components are also re-exported here for consistency - routes should
 * import all components from $lib/components, never directly from $lib/ui.
